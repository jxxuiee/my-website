                <h1>Super Rich Kids- by Frank Ocean </h1>
                    <p>For this project, I wanted to think about how songs have layers just like people do.
        Each song has a title that gives you a surface idea, verses that tell pieces of a story,
        and a chorus that repeats what sticks the most. In this song,
        Frank Ocean shows layers of wealth, routine, and emptiness — from the bright surface to whats underneath.</p>

                     <p>Start my day up on the roof. There's nothing like this type of view. Point the clicker at the tube. I prefer expensive news. New car, new girl, new ice, new glass. New watch, good times, babe, it's good times, yeah. She wash my back three times a day (Dyn-O-Mite). This shower head feels so amazin'. We'll both be high, the help don't stare. They just walk by, they must don't care. A million one, a million two. A hundred more will never do</p>

                         <p class="insight">
  This verse looks glamorous on the surface, but it is really about how wealth turns into routine — everything feels new, yet nothing actually satisfies rich kids.The kids are constantly used to getting the best of everything whenever they want, making such items lose their value. A new car or a new girl could be sources of pleasure for a poorer person, but to the kids, who want for nothing, such things are commonplace.

                             <p>Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce. Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms. The maids come around too much. Parents ain't around enough. Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar. Too many white lies and white lines. Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends. Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends.</p>

The phrase “loose ends” has some different meanings: these kids have all kinds of loose cash to spend, but that cash cannot solve a lot of their problems.Kids might be rich, but they’re often poor in terms of true friends. That’s because a lot of their friends are just people who want to chill with someone who has nice things. It just goes to show that being rich and having money is not everything.                           </p>
