                <p>Music is a big part of my life and in some ways an escape for me. I believe that it serves this purpose for a lot of us. CTRL + PLAY started with a simple idea: music can be more than something we listen to - it can be something we see, feel, and remember. 

Whether it is something you are feeling now or something you forgot you felt, I hope you will find a mood that you relate to. Maybe you will remember a song you haven’t heard in years or discover one you didn’t know you needed. </p>
